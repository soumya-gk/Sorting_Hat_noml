"You see a door with a sign saying "Do not open"? What do you do?"
"What do you choose - your favourite dessert or the new dessert?"
"Bertie Bots came out with a mystery flavor bean that can teach new spells. Do you try it?"

"A thirst for seeking the unknown I see."
"Always better to go with what you know."

"Let's try another question."

HvR,HvS,GvR,GvS (Ravenclaw)
"Would you rather play a quidditch match on broomsticks or read a book in the library?"
"Would you study in a group or by yourself for your Charms finals?"
"You just learned that You-Know-Who is approaching Hogwarts. Would you warn the others or escape to save yourself?"

"You value the company of others."
"Company of the self is most precious!"

GvS,GvH,GvR (Gryffindor)
"Will you fly out in a storm, on your broomstick, to deliver an important mail?"
"Your friend is trapped and a troll is headed her way - do you go and save her?"
"Would you use a dangerous shortcut to win a competition?"
"Would you use the new cake recipe you learnt at the risk of going wrong?"

"You like a little adventure I see."
"Better safe than sorry."

HvS,RvS,GvH,GvR (Slytherin)
"You see a classmate cheating in the History of Magic exam. Do you report him?"
"You need to make the Polyjuice potion to save a friend. But it requires you to steal from the Professor’s cabinets - would you do it?"
"Would you cheat in the Quidditch final to score winning points for your house?"

"Not afraid to bend the rules I see."
"Justice is a great value to possess."

----------------

HvR,HvS,GvR,GvS
"Your friend accidentally drops ink all over your textbook. Do you forgive them?"
"Would you share your last chocolate frog with your friend?"
"Would you give up your wizard powers to save your best friend from he-who-must-not-be-named?"

"Friendship you seem to value above all else."
"Value for the self I see."

HvS,RvS,GvH,GvR
"A bully has stolen your wand. Do you report him to the Professor or get it back yourself?"
"Hogwarts has a new rule in place - students are not allowed to play on the grounds! Do you complain or comply"

"Never back down from a fight. Good."
"Better safe than sorry."

GvH,GvS,RvS,HvR
"Wearing your wizard robes inside out is the new fashion. Would you adopt it?"

GvR,RvS
"How would you prefer to defeat your rival - a duel by wands or a game of wizard’s chess?"
"You are in the triwizard tournament - you see a huge wall with a puzzle on it. Do you solve the puzzle or blast the wall with your wand?"

GvS,HvS,RvS
"Everyone in your class is avoiding the new student because he has a bad reputation. Would you talk to him?"

GvS
"Would you - dive into a smelly pool of slush to save your pet?"

GvS,HvS,HvR,GvR
"You are late for your exam. On your way you hit into a student carrying books. Do you stay to pick up the books?"

GvS
"You are bored - would you crack a joke even if you knew it was not funny?"

GvS
"What would you like to be - the Minister for Magic or an Auror?"
"Would you explore an unknown path even if it delays you from your goal?"
"Would you keep a job where you earn a lot but makes you bored?"

"And finally"

"If you could pick one person to study magic with you who would it be?"
"If you could have any magical ability, what would it be?"

"Interesting choice!"
"Ah! I see."
"A fine choice!"

"Right Then!"

"For your qualities of bravery and friendship, I sort you into Gryffindor"
"You have an open mind and thirst for learning. You belong in Ravenclaw!"
"You are ambitious and resourceful. I sort you into Slytherin"
"For your qualities of loyalty and friendship. I sort you into Hufflepuff"
